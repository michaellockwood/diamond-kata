# Diamond Kata

Simple implementation of the [diamond kata](https://github.com/davidwhitney/CodeDojos/tree/master/Diamond%20Kata) 

## Notes
* Completed as a console app project to give a simple way to run it besides just UTs.
* Used `StringBuilder` in UTs because I found it easier to read than a verbatim string or string with escape characters in.
